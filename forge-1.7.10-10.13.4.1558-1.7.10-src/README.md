# BurlapCraft

A Mod aimed at using Minecraft as a test bed for artificial intelligence. BurlapCraft is built using BURLAP and Minecraft Forge, a Minecraft API that contains hooks into base Minecraft files. In the current release, the mod contains six dungeons, each with a specific goal that the agent needs to reach by maximizing its reward. We used BURLAP to successfully implement reinforcement learning and planning algorithms to solve these dungeons within Minecraft.
